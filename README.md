## Description

This project is helping team members manage tasks in an organzied manner. The reason behind this is to facilitate tasks for team members in an efficient way. Being able to complete these tasks will save team members time and help keep everyone on track. This project helps usability for user and keeps data stored as necessary using JWT tokens. I was able to learn how to walk through each step to make sure client and server side responded to each other. It helped me get more practice in appropriately using JWT tokens and API calls.
